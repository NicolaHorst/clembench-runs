In the background, another woman wearing a red apron over a blue top is standing behind a stall, handling some vegetables. The stall is filled with various fresh produce, including green leafy vegetables, bananas hanging above, and some potatoes. There are cardboard boxes visible, one of which is labeled "CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRIES." The setting appears to be a street market with a focus on the fresh produce and the individuals at the scene.

The horse, which appears to be in the foreground, has a brown and white coat and is wearing a red halter. The dog, in the background, has a light-colored coat.
