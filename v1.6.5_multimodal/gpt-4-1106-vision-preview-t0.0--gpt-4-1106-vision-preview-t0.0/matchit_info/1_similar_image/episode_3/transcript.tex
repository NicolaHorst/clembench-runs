	 ANSWER: In my image, the batter is in a stance preparing to swing but has not yet begun the motion. The catcher is crouched behind the plate in a typical catching position, and the umpire is standing upright behind the catcher, slightly leaning forward with hands on knees, observing the batter.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your picture and the other picture described the same picture?  Write "DECISION: same image" if you think they are the same picture or "DECISION: different images" if you think they are different pictures. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
