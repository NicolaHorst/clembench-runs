	 DESCRIPTION: The image depicts a moment from a baseball game at night. A batter, wearing a white uniform with a visible number 10, is in the midst of a swing, watching the ball that is in motion towards the right side of the frame. The catcher, wearing dark gear, and the umpire, in black, are crouched behind the batter. The scene is captured from the side, providing a clear view of the batter's profile and the action. The field is illuminated by stadium lights, and the background is out of focus, emphasizing the players in the foreground.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows an urban street scene with a stop sign in the foreground that has numerous stickers on it. Below the stop sign is a "Do Not Enter" sign. There is a woman with reddish hair in a blue top walking in front of a white car, which is partially visible. A black lamp post is directly in front of the stop sign. In the background, there are trees with autumn leaves, a brick building on the left with a "For Lease" sign and a phone number, and a dark-colored pickup truck parked on the street. The sky is overcast.
