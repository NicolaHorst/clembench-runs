There's a dedicated bike lane with a cyclist waiting at the intersection. Cars are visible on the street, and there are buildings lining both sides of the road.

To the left, there's a black office chair, and in the background, a TV is visible with something on the screen. The room looks disorganized, and there are curtains partially drawn in the background.
