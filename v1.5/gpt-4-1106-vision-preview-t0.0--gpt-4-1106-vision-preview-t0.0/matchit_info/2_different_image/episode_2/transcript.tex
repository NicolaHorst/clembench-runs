	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a city street scene during what appears to be dusk, with the warm light of the setting sun illuminating the scene. In the foreground, there is a busy street with cars and a distinctive yellow double-decker bus, indicating this might be a city where such buses are common, like Dublin. In the background, there is an imposing classical building with a large dome topped with a statue. The architecture suggests a building of significance, possibly a government or historical structure. There are modern buildings visible as well, including a tall office building to the left of the classical structure. The contrast between the old and new architecture is notable.
