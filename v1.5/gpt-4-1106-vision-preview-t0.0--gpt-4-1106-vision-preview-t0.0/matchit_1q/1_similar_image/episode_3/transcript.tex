A batter, wearing a white uniform with the name "RODRIGUEZ" and the number "33" on the back, is in the midst of swinging at a pitch. A catcher in a red and gray uniform and a home plate umpire in protective gear are crouched behind the batter. The field is lit, and the stands in the background are mostly dark, suggesting the photo was taken from a distance.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image depicts a baseball game in progress. A batter wearing a navy blue jersey with the number 10 and the name "RHYNES" on the back is standing at home plate, holding a bat and preparing to swing. A catcher in a red uniform is crouched behind the batter, and an umpire in black protective gear is standing behind the catcher. The stands in the background are sparsely populated with spectators. The field is well-maintained with visible baselines, and the scene appears to be during a late afternoon or early evening due to the shadows and lighting.
