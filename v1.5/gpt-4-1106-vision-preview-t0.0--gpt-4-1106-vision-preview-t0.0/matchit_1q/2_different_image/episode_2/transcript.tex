	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a city street scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting. In the foreground, there is a busy street with cars and a distinctive yellow double-decker bus, indicating this might be a city where such buses are common, like Dublin. In the background, there is an imposing classical building with a large dome and a statue at the top. The architecture suggests a historical or government-related building. There are modern buildings visible as well, including a tall office building to the left of the classical structure. The photo seems to have been taken from a lower perspective, looking up towards the buildings.

	 DESCRIPTION: The image shows a baseball scene with a batter wearing a white uniform with red elements and the number 11, in the midst of swinging at a pitch. A catcher in black gear is crouched behind him, and an umpire is standing in the background. The scene takes place on a baseball field, and there is a crowd in the stands. The batter's helmet is also red, and the catcher's mitt is extended towards the incoming baseball. The background shows a green outfield with a distance marker indicating 335 feet.
