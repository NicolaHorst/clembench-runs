        <p>DESCRIPTION: The image depicts an outdoor market scene. There is a woman in a purple jacket walking in front of the stall, and another woman in a red apron behind the stall, seemingly arranging or selecting produce. The stall is filled with various vegetables, including what appears to be bok choy, potatoes, and other greens. There are also bananas hanging above the stall and boxes labeled &quot;California&quot; visible at the bottom of the image.
