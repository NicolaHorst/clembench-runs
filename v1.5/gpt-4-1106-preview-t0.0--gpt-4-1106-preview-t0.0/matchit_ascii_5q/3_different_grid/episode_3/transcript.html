        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Now start your short grid description with &quot;DESCRIPTION:&quot; followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: My grid is a 5x5 square. The outer border is filled with X&#x27;s, creating a frame. Inside this frame, there is an alternating pattern of X&#x27;s and blank spaces (represented by ▢). Starting from the top left corner inside the frame, there is an X, followed by a blank space, then an X, another blank space, and finally an X to complete the row. This pattern is repeated for the three rows within the frame, so that the X&#x27;s form a cross shape in the center of the grid, with the blank spaces at the four corners inside the frame.</p>
