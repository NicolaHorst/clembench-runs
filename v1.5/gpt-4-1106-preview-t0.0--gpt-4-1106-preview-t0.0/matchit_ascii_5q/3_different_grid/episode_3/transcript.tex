Starting from the top left corner inside the frame, there is an X, followed by a blank space, then an X, another blank space, and finally an X to complete the row. This pattern is repeated for the three rows within the frame, so that the X's form a cross shape in the center of the grid, with the blank spaces at the four corners inside the frame.
