	 ANSWER: No, the "X"s in my grid are not arranged in a symmetrical pattern in any of the rows or columns. Each row and column has a unique pattern of "X"s and blank squares, with the blank squares shifting one position to the left as you move down the rows.\\ \tt QUESTION: In your grid, is there a specific pattern or sequence that the "X"s follow, such as a straight line, an L shape, or any other recognizable shape, when looking at the grid as a whole? If so, could you describe that pattern or sequence? Start your answer with "ANSWER:" and do not add anything else.

	 ANSWER: Yes, the "X"s in my grid follow a specific pattern where they form vertical lines in the columns. Specifically, there is a single vertical line of "X"s running down the center column of the grid. The first row has "X"s at both ends, and the second row has "X"s in the second and fourth positions, creating a T shape with the central vertical line.
