        <p>ANSWER: Yes, in my grid, &quot;X&quot;s are adjacent to each other both vertically and horizontally in every row and column except for the diagonal line of blank squares. The adjacencies occur as follows: in the first row, the first four &quot;X&quot;s are adjacent horizontally; in the second row, the first three &quot;X&quot;s are adjacent horizontally; in the third row, the first two &quot;X&quot;s are adjacent horizontally; in the fourth row, the last three &quot;X&quot;s are adjacent horizontally; and in the fifth row, the last four &quot;X&quot;s are adjacent horizontally. Vertically, the adjacencies are similar, with the first column having the last four &quot;X&quot;s adjacent, the second column having the last three &quot;X&quot;s adjacent, and so on, mirroring the horizontal pattern.<br/>Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write &quot;DECISION: same grid&quot; if you think they are the same grid or &quot;DECISION: different grids&quot; if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.<br/></p>
