	 DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 square. Starting from the top row, there is an empty square, followed by three filled squares (X), and ending with an empty square. The second row begins with a filled square, an empty square, a filled square, another empty square, and ends with a filled square. The third row has alternating filled and empty squares, starting and ending with filled squares. The fourth row mirrors the second row with a filled square, an empty square, a filled square, another empty square, and ends with a filled square. The fifth and final row mirrors the first row with an empty square, three filled squares, and ends with an empty square.
