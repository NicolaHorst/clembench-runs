	 DESCRIPTION: My grid consists of a 5x5 matrix. The border of the grid is filled with X's, creating a continuous frame around the grid. Inside this frame, there is an alternating pattern of X's and blank squares (▢). Starting from the second row, each row has an X in the first and last position, with alternating blank squares and X's in between. The pattern is such that the blank squares form a vertical line down the center of the grid, and two additional vertical lines, one space apart from the center line on either side. The result is a symmetrical pattern with X's at the corners and intersections, and blank squares in a "+" shape.
