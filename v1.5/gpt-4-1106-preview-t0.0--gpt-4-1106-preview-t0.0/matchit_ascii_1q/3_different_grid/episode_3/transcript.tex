	 DESCRIPTION: My grid is a 5x5 square. The border of the grid is filled with X's, creating a continuous frame around the edge. Inside this frame, there is an alternating pattern of X's and blank squares (represented by ▢). Starting from the top left corner of the inner 3x3 area (one square in from the outer X frame), there is an X. Diagonally adjacent to this X (to the right and below) is a blank square. This alternating pattern continues for each row within the inner 3x3 area, such that the middle row starts with a blank square on the left and ends with a blank square on the right, and the bottom row starts with an X on the left and ends with an X on the right.
