        <p>You are participating in a collaborative guessing game.<br/>The goal is to find out whether this grid and another picture only I can see, are the same.<br/>Please describe your grid first. Then, I will provide my description and we can ask each other questions about the grids to figure out whether they are the same. Each of us can ask 3 questions. Now start your short grid description with &quot;DESCRIPTION:&quot; followed by the description. Do not add anything else.

        <p>DESCRIPTION: My grid consists of a 5x5 matrix. The border of the grid is filled with X&#x27;s, creating a frame around the grid. Inside this frame, there is an alternating pattern of X&#x27;s and blank squares (▢). Starting from the second row, each odd column (1st, 3rd, 5th) contains an X, while each even column (2nd, 4th) contains a blank square. This pattern repeats for the second, third, and fourth rows. The center of the grid, therefore, has a cross shape made of X&#x27;s with the blank squares at the four corners of the cross.</p>
