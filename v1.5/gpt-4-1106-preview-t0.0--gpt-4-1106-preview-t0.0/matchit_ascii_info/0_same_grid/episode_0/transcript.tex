	 DESCRIPTION: My grid consists of a 5x5 matrix. The border of the grid is filled with X's, creating a frame around the grid. Inside this frame, there is an alternating pattern of X's and blank squares (▢). Starting from the second row, each odd column (1st, 3rd, 5th) contains an X, while each even column (2nd, 4th) contains a blank square. This pattern repeats for the second, third, and fourth rows. The center of the grid, therefore, has a cross shape made of X's with the blank squares at the four corners of the cross.

Inside this frame, there is an alternating pattern of X's and blank spaces (▢). Starting from the top left corner inside the frame, there is an X, followed by a blank space, then an X, another blank space, and finally an X to complete the row. This pattern is repeated for the three rows within the frame, so that the X's form a cross shape with the blank spaces in the corners and in the center of the cross.

	 ANSWER: Yes, in my grid, the X's and blank spaces (▢) in the second row are arranged in the same pattern as in the third row, meaning they alternate starting with an X.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
