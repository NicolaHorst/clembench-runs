	 ANSWER: No, in my grid, the second row does not have exactly one X in the fourth position, nor does the fourth row have exactly one X in the second position. Each row in my grid has a consecutive number of X's starting from the right, with the number of X's equal to the row number.\\ \tt Now come to a decision. What do you think: are your grid and the other grid described the same?  Write "DECISION: same grid" if you think they are the same grid or "DECISION: different grids" if you think they are different grids. Do not add anything else.\\ \tt
