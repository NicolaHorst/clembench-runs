You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:bravado\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:11.134184", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: valor\nexplanation: \"Valor\" means courage or bravery, which is closely related to \"bravado.\""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:11.134192", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "valor", "explanation": "\"Valor\" means courage or bravery, which is closely related to \"bravado.\""}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:11.134254", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = swash\ntarget_word_clue = bravado\nguess: valor\nguess_feedback: v<red> a<yellow> l<red> o<red> r<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (o1-preview-2024-09-12)", "guess": "valor", "explanation": "\"Valor\" means courage or bravery, which is closely related to \"bravado.\"", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:29.230365", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: v<red> a<yellow> l<red> o<red> r<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:29.230702", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: swank\nexplanation: The clue \"bravado\" suggests a display of boldness or swagger. \"Swank\" means stylishness or ostentatious display, which aligns with the concept of \"bravado.\" \n\nFrom the feedback on \"valor\":\n- The letter **'a'** is in the word but not in the second position (since it was **yellow** in position 2).\n- The letters **'v'**, **'l'**, **'o'**, and **'r'** are not in the word (they were marked **red**).\n\nUsing this information:\n- **'swank'** contains the letter **'a'** in the third position, satisfying the placement condition.\n- It does not include any of the letters we've eliminated.\n- All the letters in **'swank'** are new guesses except for **'a'**, helping us gather more information.\n\nTherefore, \"swank\" is a fitting next guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:29.230719", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "swank", "explanation": "The clue \"bravado\" suggests a display of boldness or swagger. \"Swank\" means stylishness or ostentatious display, which aligns with the concept of \"bravado.\""}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:29.230888", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = swash\ntarget_word_clue = bravado\nguess: swank\nguess_feedback: s<green> w<green> a<green> n<red> k<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (o1-preview-2024-09-12)", "guess": "swank", "explanation": "The clue \"bravado\" suggests a display of boldness or swagger. \"Swank\" means stylishness or ostentatious display, which aligns with the concept of \"bravado.\"", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:51.901152", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<green> w<green> a<green> n<red> k<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:51:51.901406", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:swash\nexplanation:From the previous feedback, we know that the first three letters are **s**<green>, **w**<green>, **a**<green>.
