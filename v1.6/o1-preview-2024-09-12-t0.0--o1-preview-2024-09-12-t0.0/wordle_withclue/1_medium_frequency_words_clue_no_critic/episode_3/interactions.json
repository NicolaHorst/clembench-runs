You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:hospital supply\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:35:34.638156", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: gauze\n\nexplanation: Based on the clue \"hospital supply,\" \"gauze\" is a 5-letter word that refers to a medical fabric used for dressing wounds."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:35:34.638169", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "gauze", "explanation": "Based on the clue \"hospital supply,\" \"gauze\" is a 5-letter word that refers to a medical fabric used for dressing wounds."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:35:34.638278", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = serum\ntarget_word_clue = hospital supply\nguess: gauze\nguess_feedback: g<red> a<red> u<yellow> z<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "serum", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (o1-preview-2024-09-12)", "guess": "gauze", "explanation": "Based on the clue \"hospital supply,\" \"gauze\" is a 5-letter word that refers to a medical fabric used for dressing wounds.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "hospital supply"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:35:47.936402", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: g<red> a<red> u<yellow> z<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:35:47.936633", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:tubes\nexplanation:Given the clue \"hospital supply\" and the feedback from \"gauze,\" I know the following:\n- The letters **U** and **E** are in the word but not in positions 3 and 5, respectively.\n- The letters **G**, **A**, and **Z** are not in the word.\n\nThe word **\"tubes\"** fits these criteria:\n- It's a 5-letter hospital supply.\n- It contains **U** (in position 2, not 3) and **E** (in position 4, not 5).\n- It does not contain **G**, **A**, or **Z**."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:35:47.936646", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "tubes", "explanation": "Given the clue \"hospital supply\" and the feedback from \"gauze,\" I know the following:"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:35:47.936726", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = serum\ntarget_word_clue = hospital supply\nguess: tubes\nguess_feedback: t<red> u<yellow> b<red> e<yellow> s<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "serum", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (o1-preview-2024-09-12)", "guess": "tubes", "explanation": "Given the clue \"hospital supply\" and the feedback from \"gauze,\" I know the following:", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "hospital supply"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:36:11.441502", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> u<yellow> b<red> e<yellow> s<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-18T12:36:11.441653", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:serum\nexplanation:Based on the clue \"hospital supply\" and the feedback from previous guesses, I have gathered the following information:\n\n- The letters **u**, **e**, and **s** are in the word.\n  - **u** is **not** in positions **2** or **3** (from \"gauze\" and \"tubes\" feedback where **u** was yellow in positions 3 and 2).\n  - **e** is **not** in positions **4** or **5** (from \"gauze\" and \"tubes\" feedback where **e** was yellow in positions 5 and 4).\n  - **s** is **not** in position **5** (from \"tubes\" feedback where **s** was yellow in position 5).\n\n- The letters **g**, **a**, **z**, **t**, and **b** are **not** in the word (they were marked red in previous feedback).\n\nWith these constraints, I considered words related to \"hospital supply\" that fit the known information.
