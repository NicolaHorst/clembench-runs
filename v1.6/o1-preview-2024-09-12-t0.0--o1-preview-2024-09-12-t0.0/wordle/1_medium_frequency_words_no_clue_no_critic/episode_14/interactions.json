You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:01:29.928849", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: arise  \nexplanation: I chose \"arise\" as it is a common English word that includes five frequently used letters, giving me a good starting point to identify correct letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:01:29.928860", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "arise", "explanation": "I chose \"arise\" as it is a common English word that includes five frequently used letters, giving me a good starting point to identify correct letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:01:29.928980", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = swash\nguess: arise\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> r<red> i<red> s<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (o1-preview)", "guess": "arise", "explanation": "I chose \"arise\" as it is a common English word that includes five frequently used letters, giving me a good starting point to identify correct letters.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:02:04.682773", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> r<red> i<red> s<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:02:04.682930", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: stamp\nexplanation: From the feedback on my previous guess \"arise,\" I know that the letters **'a'** and **'s'** are in the target word but not in the positions I used them.
