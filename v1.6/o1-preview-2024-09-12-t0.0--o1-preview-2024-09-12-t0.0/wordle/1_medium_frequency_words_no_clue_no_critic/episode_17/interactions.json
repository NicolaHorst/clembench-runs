You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:08:55.684253", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: raise  \nexplanation: I chose \"raise\" because it contains common vowels (a, e, i) and frequent consonants (r, s), which should help identify which letters are in the target word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:08:55.684258", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "raise", "explanation": "I chose \"raise\" because it contains common vowels (a, e, i) and frequent consonants (r, s), which should help identify which letters are in the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:08:55.684298", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = unfed\nguess: raise\nguess_feedback: r<red> a<red> i<red> s<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unfed", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (o1-preview)", "guess": "raise", "explanation": "I chose \"raise\" because it contains common vowels (a, e, i) and frequent consonants (r, s), which should help identify which letters are in the target word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:09:18.724955", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: r<red> a<red> i<red> s<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-09-13T13:09:18.725129", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: blend\nexplanation: From the feedback, I know that 'r', 'a', 'i', and 's' are not in the target word.
