It's also a five-letter word fitting the game's requirements.\n\n\n\n\nclue:repeater, maybe\nguess:ditto\nexplanation:\"Ditto\" means \"the same as stated before\" or \"repeat,\" which fits the clue \"repeater, maybe.\" It is a five-letter word that contains the letter \"i\" not in position 4 (it's in position 2). Additionally, it doesn't include any of the letters \"a,\" \"g,\" or \"n,\" which are not in the target word according to the feedback from the previous guess.\nguess_feedback: a<red> g<red> a<red> i<yellow> n<red>\n\n\n\nclue:repeater, maybe\nguess:issue\nexplanation:The word \"issue\" fits the clue \"repeater, maybe\" because it contains a repeated letter \"s\" and can mean a publication released repeatedly.

First, the Bible is a text that is read repeatedly by many people. Second, it contains repeated letters—the letter \"b\" appears twice—which aligns with the idea of repetition. According to the feedback:\nguess_feedback: i<yellow> s<red> s<red> u<red> e<green>\n\n\n\nclue:repeater, maybe\nguess:piper\nexplanation:\"Piper\" fits the clue \"repeater, maybe\" because it repeats the letter \"p\" and refers to someone who plays a pipe or flute, often repeating melodies. It aligns with the previous feedback: 'i' is correctly in position 2, 'e' is correctly in position 5, and it doesn't include any of the eliminated letters (a, b, c, d, g, l, n, o, s, t, u, w). Therefore, \"piper\" is a suitable guess.\nguess_feedback: d<red> i<green> o<red> d<red> e<green>\n\n\n\nclue:repeater, maybe\nguess:fibre\nexplanation:\"Fibre\" fits the clue \"repeater, maybe\" because fibres are composed of repeated units or strands.
