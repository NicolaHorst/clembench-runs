You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:awaiting ignition\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:20.971622", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Okay, I understand! \n\n**Here's how I'd break down the \"Wordle\" clue system:**\n\n* **Green:**  Indicates the letter is correct and in the right position.\n* **Yellow:** Indicates the letter is correct but in the wrong position.\n* **Gray:** Indicates the letter is not in the target word at all.\n\n**My first guess would be: \"CRANE\"**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Starting with common vowels:**"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:20.971625", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:20.971639", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: gemma-2-27b-it) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "unlit", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemma-2-27b-it)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT", "target_word_clue": "awaiting ignition"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:27.191423", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:27.191470", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Okay, I understand. \n\nTo play along with your \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" format, I'll need a bit more information. \n\n**Here's how I'll play:**\n\nI'll make guesses, and you tell me the result using the format:\n\n**word:**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*  **First guess:**\n\n**guess: crane**\n* **explanation:** This word contains common vowels and consonants, and the \"a\" is a"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:27.191474", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "\" and \"explanation:\" format, I'll need a bit more information.", "explanation": "\" format, I'll need a bit more information."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:27.191489", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD while parsing Player 1's (model: gemma-2-27b-it) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "unlit", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gemma-2-27b-it)", "guess": "\" and \"explanation:\" format, I'll need a bit more information.", "explanation": "\" format, I'll need a bit more information.", "error": "INVALID_WORD", "target_word_clue": "awaiting ignition"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-04T16:08:32.452817", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should contain only alphabets.
