You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:awaiting ignition\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:42.501950", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: spark\nexplanation: The clue \"awaiting ignition\" suggests something that is about to start or happen, and a \"spark\" is often associated with the initial spark needed to start a fire or engine."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:42.501954", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "spark", "explanation": "The clue \"awaiting ignition\" suggests something that is about to start or happen, and a \"spark\" is often associated with the initial spark needed to start a fire or engine."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:42.501980", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = unlit\ntarget_word_clue = awaiting ignition\nguess: spark\nguess_feedback: s<red> p<red> a<red> r<red> k<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unlit", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (aya-23-8B)", "guess": "spark", "explanation": "The clue \"awaiting ignition\" suggests something that is about to start or happen, and a \"spark\" is often associated with the initial spark needed to start a fire or engine.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "awaiting ignition"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:44.027654", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> p<red> a<red> r<red> k<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:44.027713", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "The feedback shows that none of the letters in my guess, \"spark,\" are correct, so I'll try again.\n\nclue:awaiting ignition"}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:44.027718", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT"}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:44.027738", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_FORMAT while parsing Player 1's (model: aya-23-8B) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unlit", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (aya-23-8B)", "guess": "INVALID_FORMAT", "explanation": "INVALID_FORMAT", "error": "INVALID_FORMAT", "target_word_clue": "awaiting ignition"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:45.691924", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "Provide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:45.691956", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:ignition\nexplanation:The clue \"awaiting ignition\" directly suggests the word \"ignition,\" which has five letters and is a valid guess for Wordle."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:45.691959", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "ignition", "explanation": "The clue \"awaiting ignition\" directly suggests the word \"ignition,\" which has five letters and is a valid guess for Wordle."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:45.691970", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: aya-23-8B) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unlit", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (aya-23-8B)", "guess": "ignition", "explanation": "The clue \"awaiting ignition\" directly suggests the word \"ignition,\" which has five letters and is a valid guess for Wordle.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH", "target_word_clue": "awaiting ignition"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:56:48.635155", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
