This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-06-25T19:29:43.567492", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: orange\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word that contains a variety of letters, which can be a good starting point.
