	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:woo\\ \tt

	 Sounds like a delightful challenge! Here's my first guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt **guess:** house\\ \tt **explanation:** \\ \tt Given the clue "woo", I'm interpreting it in a few possible ways to inform my initial guess:\\ \tt 1. **Sound association**: "Woo" is an expressive sound, often associated with excitement or attraction. This led me to think of words related to places where one might express such emotions, like a "house" (e.g., a home with loved ones, or a house

	 It seems like I provided the guess correctly this time, but the explanation was missing. Here's a complete attempt:\\ \tt \\ \tt guess: **house**\\ \tt explanation: \\ \tt * The clue "woo" suggests a relation to excitement, enthusiasm, or a sound of delight. \\ \tt * While there's no direct connection between "woo" and "house", I'm starting with a common, everyday 5-letter word to maximize the chance of getting at least one letter correct (green or yellow).\\ \tt * "House"
