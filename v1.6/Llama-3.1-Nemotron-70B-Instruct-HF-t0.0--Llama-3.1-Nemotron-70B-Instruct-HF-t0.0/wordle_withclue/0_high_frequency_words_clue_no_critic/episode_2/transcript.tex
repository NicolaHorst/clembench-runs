	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:bronze place\\ \tt

	 Sounds like a fascinating challenge! Here's my first guess, carefully crafted by weaving together the threads of the clue and linguistic intuition.\\ \tt \\ \tt **guess:** Arena\\ \tt **explanation:**\\ \tt Considering the clue "bronze place", I've made an educated guess by breaking down the clue into its key components:\\ \tt 1. **Bronze**: Often associated with awards, statues, or historical artifacts. This led me to think of places where bronze items are commonly found or awarded.\\ \tt 2. **Place**: Suggest

	 Here's a new attempt:\\ \tt \\ \tt guess:** Medal\\ \tt explanation:**\\ \tt * **Connection to "bronze"**: Bronze is a metal often associated with medals, particularly in award ceremonies (e.g., Olympics, where bronze medals are given to third-place finishers).\\ \tt * **Connection to "place"**: A medal can signify a place or ranking (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) in a competition.\\ \tt * **Five-letter constraint**: The word "Medal" fits the

	 Here's another attempt at a guess, ensuring the word contains only alphabets (a-z) and considering the clue "bronze place":\\ \tt \\ \tt guess:** Bronze\\ \tt explanation:**\\ \tt * **Direct Connection**: The clue mentions "bronze", so I'm testing if the word itself or a closely related word could be the target.\\ \tt * **Place Association**: While "bronze" isn't typically a place, I'm considering the possibility that the "place" part of the clue might refer to
