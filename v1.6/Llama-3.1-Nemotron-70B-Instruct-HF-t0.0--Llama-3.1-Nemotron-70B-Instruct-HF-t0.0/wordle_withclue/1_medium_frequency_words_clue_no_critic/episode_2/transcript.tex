	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:awaiting ignition\\ \tt

	 Sounds like a thrilling challenge! Here's my first guess, carefully crafted with the clue in mind:\\ \tt \\ \tt **guess:** flint\\ \tt **explanation:** The clue "awaiting ignition" suggests something that is ready to be set off or sparked. Flint is a material commonly associated with creating sparks, especially in fire starting (e.g., flint and steel). Given the context of awaiting ignition, flint seems a fitting word, and conveniently, it matches the required 5-letter length.\\ \tt \\ \tt Please provide

	 guess:** spark\\ \tt explanation:** The clue "awaiting ignition" implies something is ready to be set off or lit. The word "spark" is closely related to ignition, as a spark is often what initiates combustion or an explosion.
