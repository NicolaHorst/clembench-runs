	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:square\\ \tt

	 Sounds like a delightful challenge! Here's my first guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt **guess:** house\\ \tt **explanation:** \\ \tt Considering the clue "square", I'm drawing a connection between the shape and a common, everyday context where squares are often found - architecture. A "house" is a familiar, square-shaped building (when viewed from above or in a simplified representation). Additionally, "house" meets the criteria of being a valid English word with exactly 5 lowercase letters (a-z). This initial guess aims

	 Here's my first attempt:\\ \tt \\ \tt **guess:** house\\ \tt **explanation:**\\ \tt Based on the clue "square", I'm making an educated guess by associating the concept of a square with something commonly found within or related to a square shape in various contexts.
