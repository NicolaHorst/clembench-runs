	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For instance, if your guess is "apple", your response should be\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt  explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.

"House" is a relatively frequent word in language, increasing the likelihood of at least one or two letters being correct. This guess aims to fish for both vowel and consonant presence, providing a broad foundation for subsequent adjustments based on the feedback.

	 That's a clarification rather than a correction, since "house" already meets the criterion of containing only alphabets.

	 It seems the request to "contain only alphabets" is more about confirming the absence of non-alphabet characters (like numbers, symbols, etc.) in the guess, which is inherently met since we're dealing with words. Given that, my initial response already complies. However, to reiterate with a fresh acknowledgment of the rule:\\ \tt \\ \tt guess:** house\\ \tt explanation:** \\ \tt 1. **Compliance Confirmation**: This guess consists solely of alphabets (h-o-u-s-e), adher
