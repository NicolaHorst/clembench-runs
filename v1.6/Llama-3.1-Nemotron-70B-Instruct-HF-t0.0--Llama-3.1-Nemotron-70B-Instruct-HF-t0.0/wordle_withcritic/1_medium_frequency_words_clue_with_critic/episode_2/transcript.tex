	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: "snowy white"\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt Here are some rules to keep in mind:\\ \tt 1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\\ \tt 2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt clue:awaiting ignition\\ \tt

	 Sounds like a thrilling challenge! Here's my inaugural guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt **guess:** flint\\ \tt **explanation:** The clue "awaiting ignition" suggests something that is ready to be set off or sparked. Flint is a material commonly associated with creating sparks, especially in fire starting (e.g., flint and steel). It fits the 5-letter criteria, making it a plausible initial guess in the context of awaiting ignition.\\ \tt \\ \tt Please provide your agreement/disagreement rationale and the **guess_feedback** (

	 Here's another attempt:\\ \tt \\ \tt clue: awaiting ignition\\ \tt guess: **spark**\\ \tt explanation: The clue "awaiting ignition" implies something is ready to be ignited or set off. The word "spark" is closely related to ignition, as a spark is often what initiates combustion or an explosion.

	 I was already adhering to that rule in my previous response.
