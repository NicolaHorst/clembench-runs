        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/>To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: &quot;snowy white&quot;<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>Here are some rules to keep in mind:<br/>1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own<br/>2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/><br/>clue:rule<br/></p>

        <p>guess: bleur<br/>explanation: The clue &quot;rule&quot; might suggest a word related to regulations or guidelines. However, the word &quot;bleur&quot; does not seem to directly relate to the clue. Considering the rules, I&#x27;m inclined to think the target word might contain common letters found in &quot;rule&quot; such as &#x27;l&#x27; and &#x27;e&#x27;. My guess is an attempt to incorporate these letters, but it may not be the most logical guess based on</p>

        <p>clue:rule<br/>guess:rule<br/>explanation:Upon reevaluation, I acknowledge that my initial guess &quot;bleur&quot; does not meet the game&#x27;s requirement of a 5-letter word. Given the clue &quot;rule,&quot; I should focus on a 5-letter word that is directly associated with the concept of rules. A more appropriate guess would be &quot;code,&quot; as rules can be seen as a form of code that governs behavior or systems.&lt;|end|&gt;</p>

The clue &quot;rule&quot; suggests a word that is inherently connected to the idea of rules.
