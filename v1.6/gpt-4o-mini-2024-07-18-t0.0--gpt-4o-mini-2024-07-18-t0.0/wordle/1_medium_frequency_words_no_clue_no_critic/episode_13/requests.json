You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "guess:table\nexplanation:I am starting with \"table\" because it contains common letters and provides a good mix of vowels and consonants, which can help identify correct letters and their positions.\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<green> e<green>"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "guess:lemon\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letters 't', 'a', 'b' are not in the word at all, while 'l' and 'e' are in the correct positions (4th and 5th).
