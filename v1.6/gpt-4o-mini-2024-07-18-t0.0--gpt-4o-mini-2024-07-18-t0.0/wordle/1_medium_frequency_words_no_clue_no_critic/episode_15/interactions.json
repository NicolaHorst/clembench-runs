You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:16:10.994679", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: table  \nexplanation: I am starting with the word \"table\" because it contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which can help identify potential correct letters in the target word. \n\nPlease provide the feedback for this guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:16:10.994688", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "I am starting with the word \"table\" because it contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which can help identify potential correct letters in the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:16:10.994730", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = gloat\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "gloat", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "I am starting with the word \"table\" because it contains a mix of common letters and vowels, which can help identify potential correct letters in the target word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:16:12.307334", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:16:12.307453", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:alert\nexplanation: Based on the feedback, the letters 't', 'a', and 'l' are in the word but in different positions, while 'b' and 'e' are not in the word at all.
