You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:15:35.182557", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: table  \nexplanation: I chose \"table\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which will help me identify potential letters in the target word. \n\nPlease provide the feedback for this guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:15:35.182566", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "I chose \"table\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which will help me identify potential letters in the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:15:35.182605", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = fiery\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "fiery", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "I chose \"table\" as my first guess because it is a common five-letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants, which will help me identify potential letters in the target word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:15:36.758543", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:15:36.758662", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: other\nexplanation: Based on the feedback, none of the letters in \"table\" are correct except for 'e', which is in the wrong position.
