At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\n\nPlease respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\nagreement:yes or no\nexplanation:your reason for doing so\n\nPlease note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\n\nLet's begin!\n\nclue:square\nguess:shape\nexplanation:A square is a geometric shape, and the word \"shape\" has 5 letters, fitting the criteria for the guess.\n\n\n\n\nclue:square\nguess:stone\nexplanation:The word \"stone\" relates to the idea of a square in terms of construction or building materials, as stones can be cut into square shapes.

You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red).
