This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T14:52:10.631561", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "I'm excited to play Wordle!\n\nMy first guess is:\nguess: house\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter English word that is easy to guess.
