You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:insignificant<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:minor\nexplanation:The word \"minor\" has 5 letters and is related to the concept of being insignificant, which fits with the clue.||<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:insignificant\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the guess \"minor\" is related to the concept of being insignificant, but the clue \"insignificant\" implies a more general or absolute sense of insignificance, whereas \"minor\" suggests a comparative or relative sense of insignificance.||<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:insignificant\nguess:null\nexplanation:Since the guess \"minor\" was related to the concept of being insignificant, but not quite fitting the clue's implication, I'll try to think of a word that conveys a more absolute sense of insignificance.
