This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:hospital supply\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-24T15:56:10.066245", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "What a fascinating clue!\n\nguess: glove\nexplanation: Hospitals often use medical gloves as a supply to maintain hygiene and prevent the spread of infections.
