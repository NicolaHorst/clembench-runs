This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess: slate\nexplanation: this word contains a mix of vowels and consonants, and it's a common five-letter English word that provides a good starting point for gathering information about the target word.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> l<red> a<red> t<red> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess: steve\nexplanation: based on the feedback, 's' and 'e' are correct and in their respective positions, while 'l', 'a', and 't' are incorrect.
