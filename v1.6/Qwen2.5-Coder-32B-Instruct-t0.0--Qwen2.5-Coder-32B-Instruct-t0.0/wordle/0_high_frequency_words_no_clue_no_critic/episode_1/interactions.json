You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nDo not generate any other text.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-14T12:17:58.014957", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: slate\nexplanation: this word contains a mix of vowels and consonants, and it's a common five-letter English word that provides a good starting point for gathering information about the target word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-14T12:17:58.015377", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts = 1\ntarget_word = table\nguess = slate\nguess_feedback = s<red> l<yellow> a<yellow> t<yellow> e<green>"}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-14T12:17:58.015500", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> l<yellow> a<yellow> t<yellow> e<green>\n\nProvide your response only in this format.\nguess: word\nexplanation: details"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-14T12:18:02.634735", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: later\nexplanation: based on the feedback, 'e' is confirmed to be in the correct position, and 'l', 'a', and 't' are present but in the wrong positions.
