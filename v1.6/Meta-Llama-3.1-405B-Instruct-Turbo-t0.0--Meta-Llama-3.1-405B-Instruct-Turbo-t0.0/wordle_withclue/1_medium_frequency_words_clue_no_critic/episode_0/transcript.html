        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:the a in &quot;cat scan&quot;<br/></p>

        <p>What a fascinating clue!<br/><br/>guess: atlas<br/>explanation: The clue mentions &quot;cat scan,&quot; which is a medical imaging technique. I&#x27;m guessing that the word &quot;atlas&quot; might be related to the concept of scanning or imaging, as an atlas is a collection of maps or images. Additionally, the word &quot;atlas&quot; has 5 letters and contains the letter &quot;a,&quot; which is explicitly mentioned in the clue.<br/><br/>Please provide the feedback, and I&#x27;ll use it to inform my next guess</p>
