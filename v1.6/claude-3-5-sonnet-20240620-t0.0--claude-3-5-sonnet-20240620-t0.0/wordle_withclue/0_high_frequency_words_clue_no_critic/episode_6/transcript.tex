	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:place to play\\ \tt

	 Understood. I'll play the role of a language wizard guessing words based on the given rules and clues. Let's start with the first guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt guess: parks\\ \tt explanation: Based on the clue "place to play," parks are common areas where people go to play and enjoy outdoor activities. The word "parks" fits the five-letter requirement and is directly related to the given clue.

	 Thank you for the feedback. It appears that none of the letters in "parks" are correct. Let's try a different approach.\\ \tt \\ \tt guess: field\\ \tt explanation: Given the clue "place to play" and the feedback from the previous guess, we need to explore other options. A "field" is another common place where people play, especially for sports. It's a five-letter word that doesn't contain any of the letters from "parks," which we now know are incorrect.
