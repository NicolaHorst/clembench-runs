	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:embark\\ \tt

	 Understood. I'll start guessing based on the clue "embark" and provide explanations for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt guess: begin\\ \tt explanation: The word "begin" is closely related to "embark" as both mean to start or commence something. It's a five-letter word that fits the Wordle criteria.

	 Thank you for the feedback. It appears that none of the letters in "begin" are correct. Let's try a different approach based on this information and the original clue.\\ \tt \\ \tt guess: start\\ \tt explanation: Since "begin" was completely incorrect, we need to use different letters. "Start" is another synonym for "embark," maintaining the connection to the clue. It's a five-letter word that doesn't use any of the letters we now know are incorrect (b,
