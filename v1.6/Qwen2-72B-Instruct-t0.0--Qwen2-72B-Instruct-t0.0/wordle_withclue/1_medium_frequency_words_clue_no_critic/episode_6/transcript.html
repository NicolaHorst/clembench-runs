        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:chin indentation<br/></p>

        <p>guess: dimple<br/>explanation: A chin indentation is often referred to as a dimple, and this word fits the 5-letter requirement. The clue directly relates to the meaning of the word, making it a strong initial guess.</p>

        <p>guess:dimpl<br/>explanation:I removed the last letter from &quot;dimple&quot; to meet the 5-letter requirement. The word &quot;dimpl&quot; still closely relates to the clue of a chin indentation, as it is a variation of the word &quot;dimple.&quot; However, since &quot;dimple&quot; is not a valid 5-letter word, I have adjusted the guess accordingly.<br/>guess_feedback: d&lt;green&gt; i&lt;green&gt; m&lt;green&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;red&gt;</p>

        <p>guess:chink<br/>explanation:Considering the clue &quot;chin indentation,&quot; &quot;chink&quot; could be a possible word, as it can refer to a small opening or gap. Although it is not the most direct interpretation of the clue, it is a valid 5-letter word that relates to the concept of an indentation or a small gap in a surface, which could potentially apply to a chin.</p>

        <p>guess:chinny<br/>explanation:Given the clue &quot;chin indentation,&quot; &quot;chinny&quot; could be a potential word. It is a less common term, but it can be associated with the chin area. By adding the suffix &quot;-ny&quot; to &quot;chin,&quot; it implies a characteristic related to the chin, possibly referring to an indentation or feature on the chin. While not a direct match for the clue, it is a valid 5-letter word that maintains a connection to the chin area.<br/>```</p>

Although &quot;chinzy&quot; typically means cheap or stingy, it is a valid 5-letter word. By replacing the &quot;n&quot; with a &quot;z,&quot; it still maintains a phonetic similarity to &quot;chin&quot; while adhering to the 5-letter requirement.

        <p>guess:notch<br/>explanation:Considering the clue &quot;chin indentation,&quot; &quot;notch&quot; is a valid 5-letter word that directly relates to the concept of an indentation or a small gap. A notch can be a groove or a V-shaped cut in a surface, which can be analogous to an indentation on a chin.
