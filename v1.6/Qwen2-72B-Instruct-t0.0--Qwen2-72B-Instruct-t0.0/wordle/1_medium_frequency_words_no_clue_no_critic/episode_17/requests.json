You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:crane\nexplanation:this word contains a mix of common and less common letters, which could potentially give good feedback on what letters to use next. The 'c', 'r', and 'n' are common letters, while 'a' and 'e' are vowels that often appear in words. This balance may increase the chances of getting useful feedback.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:slate\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that 'n' and 'e' are in the word but misplaced. To maximize the chance of correctly placing these letters, I chose 'slate', which includes 'n' and 'e' in different positions. Additionally, 's', 'l', and 't' are common letters that haven't been used yet, increasing the likelihood of finding more correct letters.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<red> l<red> a<red> t<red> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:brine\nexplanation:Given that 'e' is still misplaced, I've chosen 'brine' as it places 'e' in a different position. Moreover, 'b', 'r', 'i', and 'n' are all new letters that haven't been attempted yet, providing an opportunity to discover more correct letters. The inclusion of 'n' is based on the previous feedback that it is part of the word but also misplaced.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> i<red> n<yellow> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:shyly\nexplanation:With 'n' and 'e' still not in their correct positions, I've selected 'shyly' to explore different arrangements for these letters. This word introduces new letters ('s', 'h', 'y', 'l') while keeping 'n' and 'e'. The choice of 'y' as a vowel alternative to 'a' or 'i' is based on its occasional use as a vowel in five-letter words.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<red> h<red> y<red> l<red> y<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:venom\nexplanation:Since none of the letters in 'shyly' were correct, I've opted for 'venom', which includes the previously confirmed 'n' and 'e' in different positions. This word also introduces new letters ('v', 'o', 'm'), providing another opportunity to find correct letters. The selection of 'o' as a vowel is based on its frequency in five-letter words.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: v<red> e<yellow> n<yellow> o<red> m<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
