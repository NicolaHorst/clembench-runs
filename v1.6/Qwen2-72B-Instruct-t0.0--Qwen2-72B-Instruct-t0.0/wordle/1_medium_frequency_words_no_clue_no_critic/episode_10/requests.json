You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:crane\nexplanation:this word contains a mix of common and less common letters, which could potentially give good feedback on what letters to use next. The 'c', 'r', and 'n' are common letters, while 'a' and 'e' are vowels that often appear in words. This balance may increase the chances of getting useful feedback.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<green> r<yellow> a<yellow> n<red> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:clerk\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that 'c' is in the correct position, and 'r', 'a', and 'e' are in the word but misplaced. Using these letters, I've formed the word \"clerk\", placing 'r', 'a', and 'e' in different positions than in the previous guess. This should help determine their correct placements.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<green> l<red> e<yellow> r<yellow> k<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:crepe\nexplanation:Given the feedback, 'c' remains in the correct position, while 'e' and 'r' are still in the word but not in their current positions. I've chosen the word \"crepe\" because it keeps 'c' in place and rearranges 'e' and 'r'. Additionally, it introduces two new letters, 'p' and 'o', neither of which were present in the previous guesses.
