You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:crane\nexplanation:this word contains a mix of common and less common letters, which could potentially give good feedback on what letters to use next. The 'c', 'r', and 'n' are common letters, while 'a' and 'e' are vowels that often appear in words. This balance may increase the chances of getting useful feedback.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<green> n<red> e<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:slate\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that 'a' is in the correct position, but none of the other letters ('c', 'r', 'n', 'e') are part of the target word. To maximize the chance of getting more letters right, I'll choose a word with different letters that also includes an 'a'. 'slate' has no letters in common with 'crane', except for 'a', and it includes a mix of common and uncommon letters.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> l<yellow> a<green> t<red> e<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:shave\nexplanation:With the feedback from 'slate', we know that 's' and 'a' are in the correct positions, and 'l' is in the word but misplaced. To find the remaining two letters, I've chosen 'h', 'v', and 'e', which haven't been used yet. 'shave' keeps 's' and 'a' in their correct positions and includes 'l' in a different spot, while introducing new letters\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> h<red> a<green> v<red> e<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:slump\nexplanation:Since 'shave' did not provide any new correct letters, I'm trying a different approach by keeping 's' and 'a' in their correct positions and changing the other three letters. 'slump' includes 'l', which was previously yellow, in a different position, and introduces 'u' and 'm' as potential candidates for the remaining letters.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> l<yellow> u<red> m<yellow> p<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:slang\nexplanation:From the feedback on 'slump', we know that 's' and 'l' are in the correct positions, and 'm' is in the word but misplaced. Since 'a' is also in the correct position, I've chosen 'lang' as the suffix, which includes 'm' in a different spot and introduces 'n' and 'g' as potential candidates for the remaining letters.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<green> l<yellow> a<green> n<red> g<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
