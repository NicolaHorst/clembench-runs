You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:crane\nexplanation:this word contains a mix of common and less common letters, which could potentially give good feedback on what letters to use next. The 'c', 'r', and 'n' are common letters, while 'a' and 'e' are vowels that often appear in words. This balance may increase the chances of getting useful feedback.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:stone\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that 'e' is in the word but misplaced. The letters 'c', 'r', 'a', and 'n' are not in the word. Choosing 'stone' as the next guess allows me to keep 'e' but in a different position, while introducing new letters 's', 't', 'o', and 'n' that haven't been ruled out yet.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> o<red> n<red> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:brave\nexplanation:Since none of the letters in 'stone' were correct, I'm introducing a new set of letters with 'brave'. This guess keeps the 'e' in a different position, as it was marked yellow before, indicating it's part of the word but not in the last position. The letters 'b', 'r', 'a', and 'v' haven't been tried yet and are common enough to potentially be part of the word.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<red> a<red> v<red> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:theme\nexplanation:Given that 'e' is still yellow, meaning it's in the word but not in the last position, I've chosen 'theme' as the next guess. This word introduces new letters 't', 'h', 'm', which haven't been marked red yet, and places 'e' in a different position again. If 'e' remains yellow, it suggests it's not in the third position either, helping to narrow down its location.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: t<red> h<red> e<green> m<red> e<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:beige\nexplanation:With 'e' confirmed in the correct position, I'm now focusing on finding the other four letters. 'beige' introduces new letters 'b', 'i', 'g', and 'j', none of which have been marked red so far. Since 'e' is green in the second position, I'm keeping it there and trying a combination of new letters around it to see if any match.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: b<red> e<yellow> i<yellow> g<red> e<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
