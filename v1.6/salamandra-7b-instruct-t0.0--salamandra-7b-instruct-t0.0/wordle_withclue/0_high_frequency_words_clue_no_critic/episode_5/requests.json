You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\n Here is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\n After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\n For example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\n The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\n Let's begin with your first guess.\nclue:woo\n<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nguess:INVALID_FORMAT\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT\n<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> user\nProvide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nguess:INVALID_FORMAT\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT\n<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> user\nProvide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again<|im_end|> \n<|im_start|> assistant\nguess:apple\nexplanation:In the fairy tale Snow White, the character named Apple falls into a deep sleep after eating a poisonous fruit that resembles an apple.
