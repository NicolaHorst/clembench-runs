	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:sandwich decoration\\ \tt

	 Guess: sandwich\\ \tt Explanation: A common way to decorate a sandwich would involve adding some sort of garnish like lettuce leaves, tomato slices, cucumber strips, etc., so it makes sense that this could potentially fit into our puzzle here too since we want something related to food items/ingredients used when making meals/snacks. However... there isn’t really any connection between “decoration” & “food”, hence why I chose not mention

	 Guess: sandwich\\ \tt Explanation: A common food item that could serve as a sandwich filling would be cheese. Cheese comes from milk, so it fits into the theme of dairy products mentioned earlier. Additionally, many types of cheeses come in different colors like yellow, orange, red, green, blue, etc., making them suitable choices when considering color themes too. These factors suggest why someone might choose 'cheese' over other options available during lunchtime conversations among friends/col
