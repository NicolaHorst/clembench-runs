	 You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\\ \tt \\ \tt Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags "guess:" and "explanation:" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt  To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\\ \tt clue: snowy white.\\ \tt \\ \tt Here is an example guess based on the clue:\\ \tt guess: apple\\ \tt explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\\ \tt \\ \tt After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt For example, the feedback for "apple" might be:\\ \tt guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\\ \tt \\ \tt The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let's begin with your first guess.\\ \tt clue:court event\\ \tt

	 Guess: courtesan\\ \tt Explanation: A courtier is someone who serves in a royal court, often attending formal events like courtships. Therefore, it makes sense that 'courtevents' could refer to these types of gatherings where people dress up formally and interact socially. However, since there isnâ€™t any specific information provided regarding what kind of activity takes place during such occasions - whether they involve dancing, music performances etc., we cannot determine if this particular term fits

	 Guess: court event\\ \tt Explanation: A court event could refer to any legal proceeding that takes place within a judicial system. It may involve trials, hearings, or other formal meetings where judges, juries, and litigants gather to discuss cases and reach decisions. Court events often follow specific protocols and procedures established by law, ensuring fairness and impartiality throughout the process. They play a crucial role in maintaining justice and upholding the rule of law in society.<|im_end|>
