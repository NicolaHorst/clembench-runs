        <p>You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.<br/><br/>Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags &quot;guess:&quot; and &quot;explanation:&quot; to provide a concise explanation for each guess.<br/><br/> To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as<br/>clue: snowy white.<br/><br/>Here is an example guess based on the clue:<br/>guess: apple<br/>explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.<br/><br/>After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.<br/><br/>For example, the feedback for &quot;apple&quot; might be:<br/>guess_feedback: a&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;yellow&gt; p&lt;green&gt; l&lt;yellow&gt; e&lt;red&gt;<br/><br/>The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.<br/><br/>Let&#x27;s begin with your first guess.<br/>clue:awaiting ignition<br/></p>

        <p>Guess: battery<br/>Explanation: Batteries often store energy that powers devices like smartphones and laptops. They typically consist of multiple cells connected in series or parallel arrangements. A single cell contains electrodes immersed in a conductive electrolyte solution. When these two terminals connect via external circuitry, electrons flow from one terminal through the device(s) being powered back into the other terminal. If we consider our current context where someone says they need something before starting their car</p>

        <p>guess:battery<br/>explanation:In many electric vehicles, batteries play a crucial role in powering their engines. They store electrical energy that drives the vehicle forward when needed. A battery also helps regulate voltage levels within the car’s electronic systems so everything runs smoothly without any issues arising from inconsistent voltages caused by fluctuations during charging cycles etcetera.&lt;|im_end|&gt;</p>
