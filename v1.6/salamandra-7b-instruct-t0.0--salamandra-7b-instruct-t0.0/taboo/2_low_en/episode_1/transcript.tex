	 You are playing a collaborative word guessing game in which you have to describe a target word for another player to guess.\\ \tt \\ \tt Rules:\\ \tt (a) You have to reply in the form: CLUE: <some text>. Guesses from the other player will start with GUESS.\\ \tt (b) You cannot use the target word itself, parts or morphological variants of it in your description.\\ \tt (c) In addition, the same rules apply for related words which are provided below.\\ \tt \\ \tt End conditions:\\ \tt (i) If you use the target word or a related word in your description, then you lose.\\ \tt (ii) If the other player can guess the target word in 3 tries, you both win.\\ \tt \\ \tt Let us start.\\ \tt \\ \tt This is the target word that you need to describe and that the other player needs to guess:\\ \tt \\ \tt synthesis\\ \tt \\ \tt Related words are:\\ \tt \\ \tt - mixture\\ \tt - amalgamation\\ \tt - blend\\ \tt \\ \tt Important: You are under time pressure, give short descriptions that are to the point!

	 CLUE: Synthesis is when two different things come together to create something new. Itâ€™s like mixing colors to make a painting or combining ingredients to bake a cake. Think about how music can be created through the combination of instruments and voices. So basically, synthesis means putting pieces together to make something unique and special.<|im_end|>
