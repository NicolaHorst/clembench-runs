You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-10-16T12:48:33.301245", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Guess: salamander\nExplanation: I chose 'salamander' because it contains all five vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and has only one letter that appears more than once ('d').
