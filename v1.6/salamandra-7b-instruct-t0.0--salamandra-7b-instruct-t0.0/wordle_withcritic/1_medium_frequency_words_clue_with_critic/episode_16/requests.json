The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.\n\n Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:\nagreement:yes or no\nexplanation:your reason for doing so\n\n Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.\n\n Let's begin!\n\n clue:swelter\nguess:sunny\nexplanation:The sun emits light energy that warms objects including people.
