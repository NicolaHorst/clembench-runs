This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:file<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nguess:light\nexplanation:The clue \"file\" could refer to a digital file or a physical file.  \"Light\" is a common word associated with both concepts, as in \"light file size\" or \"light file cabinet\".<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: l<red> i<red> g<red> h<red> t<red><end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nguess:sound\nexplanation:The feedback tells us that none of the letters in \"light\" are in the word.  Since \"file\" can refer to a physical object, I'm thinking of words related to storage or organization. \"Sound\" could relate to a sound file or a sound system used for organization.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: s<red> o<red> u<yellow> n<red> d<red><end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nguess:count\nexplanation:The feedback tells us that \"u\" is in the word but in the wrong position.  Since \"file\" can refer to a list or record, I'm thinking of words related to numbers or quantities. \"Count\" fits this theme and uses the \"u\" in a different position.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> o<red> u<yellow> n<red> t<red><end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nguess:vouch\nexplanation:We know \"u\" is in the word, but not in the third position.  \"Vouch\" uses \"u\" in the second position and relates to  \"file\" in the sense of providing evidence or support for something, which could be related to a file's contents.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: v<red> o<red> u<yellow> c<red> h<red><end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nguess:front\nexplanation:We know \"u\" is in the word, but not in the second or third position. \"Front\" uses \"u\" in the fourth position and relates to \"file\" in the sense of a file's front cover or the front of a line of files.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nguess_feedback: f<red> r<red> o<red> n<red> t<red><end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nguess:  music\nexplanation:  We've eliminated most of the alphabet.  \"Music\" is a five-letter word that doesn't share any letters with our previous guesses and could relate to \"file\" in the sense of music files. \n\n\n<end_of_turn><eos>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-07-04 16:00:40.554838", "call_duration": "0:00:03.079597", "response": "guess:  music\nexplanation:  We've eliminated most of the alphabet.  \"Music\" is a five-letter word that doesn't share any letters with our previous guesses and could relate to \"file\" in the sense of music files. \n\n\n", "model_name": "gemma-2-9b-it"}}}]
