Given the feedback and the constraint of the word having exactly 5 letters, I will adjust my strategy. Since all letters in \"banana\" were marked as red, they do not match the target word. I will now choose a word with distinct letters that haven not been used yet, such as \"crisp\".\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters. Please try again<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:crisp\nexplanation:Considering the feedback from previous guesses, all letters were incorrect or misplaced. I am choosing \"crisp\" as it contains unique letters not used before and has no vowels, aiming to narrow down the possibilities effectively.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> i<green> s<red> p<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:crisp\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, 'c' is incorrect, 'r' is in the right position, 'i' is in the right spot, 's' is incorrect, and 'p' is incorrect.
