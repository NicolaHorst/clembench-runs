You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:apeel\nexplanation:From the feedback, 'a' is yellow, meaning it's in the right spot. 'p' and 'e' are red, so they they're not in the word at all. 'l' is yellow, so it's in the word but in the wrong place. Therefore, I'm replacing the 'p' with 'l' and keeping the rest of the word as it was.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game. Please try again<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:apple\nexplanation:As per the instruction, I started with a common five-letter English word.

'b' and 'l' are red, meaning they're not in the word at all. 'b' is also yellow, so it's in the word but in the wrong place. Therefore, I'm replacing the 'b' with 'l' from the previous guess, resulting in 'all'.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
