This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow><|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nguess:plape\nexplanation:From the feedback, 'a' and 'p' are red, meaning they letters are not in the target word.
