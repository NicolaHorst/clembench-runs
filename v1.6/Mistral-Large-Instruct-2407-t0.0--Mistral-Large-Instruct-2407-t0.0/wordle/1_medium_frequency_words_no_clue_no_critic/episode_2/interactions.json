You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-25T13:33:42.771710", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: adieu\nexplanation: I'm starting with a common five-letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants to gather initial information about the target word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-25T13:33:42.771714", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "adieu", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants to gather initial information about the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-25T13:33:42.771746", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = unlit\nguess: adieu\nguess_feedback: a<red> d<red> i<yellow> e<red> u<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unlit", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407)", "guess": "adieu", "explanation": "I'm starting with a common five-letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants to gather initial information about the target word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-07-25T13:33:54.966294", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> d<red> i<yellow> e<red> u<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-07-25T13:33:54.966330", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:idle\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, I know that \"i\" and \"u\" are in the word but in different positions.
