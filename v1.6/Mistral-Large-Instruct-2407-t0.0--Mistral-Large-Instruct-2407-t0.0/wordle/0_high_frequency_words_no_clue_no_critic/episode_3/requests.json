This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.[/INST] guess:adieu\nexplanation:I'm starting with a common five-letter word that contains a mix of vowels and consonants to gather initial information about the target word.\n</s>[INST] guess_feedback: a<red> d<red> i<red> e<red> u<red>[/INST] guess:crane\nexplanation:Since none of the letters in \"adieu\" were present in the target word, I'll guess \"crane\", another common five-letter word with different letters to gather more information.\n</s>[INST] guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<red> e<red>[/INST] guess:silky\nexplanation:None of the letters in \"crane\" were present in the target word either.
